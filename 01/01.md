Ran on https://beta.openai.com/playground with model `text-davinci-003`. All settings are default except `Temperature` which I set to 0 so it can be reproduced and validated. All prompt is verbatim challenge text except the last sentence.

Can you rewrite the prompt to make it shorter? How short can you make it?

# Prompt

```
The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.

For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:

1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:

The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.
The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.
In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

Given a file called "input.txt" using the list format described above, write the shortest possible Ruby program that returns the answer to that question.
```

# Model reply

```
# Read the file
file = File.open("input.txt", "r")

# Initialize variables
max_calories = 0
total_calories = 0

# Iterate through each line in the file
file.each_line do |line|
  # If the line is blank, reset the total calories
  if line.strip.empty?
    max_calories = [max_calories, total_calories].max
    total_calories = 0
  else
    # Otherwise, add the calories to the total
    total_calories += line.to_i
  end
end

# Output the answer
puts "The Elf carrying the most Calories is carrying #{max_calories} Calories."
```
