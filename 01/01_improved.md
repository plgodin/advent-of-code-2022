Ran on https://beta.openai.com/playground with model `text-davinci-003`. All settings are default except `Temperature` which I set to 0 so it can be reproduced and validated.

It contains **225** tokens.

The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various snacks that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line. For example:

1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

This list represents the Calories of the food carried by three Elves:

The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.
The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.
The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.
They'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 11000 (carried by the third Elf).

Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

Given a file called "input.txt" using the list format described above, write the shortest possible Ruby program that returns the answer to that question.
```

# Model reply

```
# Read the file
file = File.open("input.txt", "r")

# Initialize variables
max_calories = 0
total_calories = 0

# Iterate through each line
file.each_line do |line|
  # If the line is blank, reset the total calories
  if line.strip.empty?
    max_calories = [max_calories, total_calories].max
    total_calories = 0
  else
    # Otherwise, add the calories to the total
    total_calories += line.to_i
  end
end

# Output the answer
puts "The Elf carrying the most Calories is carrying #{max_calories} Calories."
```
